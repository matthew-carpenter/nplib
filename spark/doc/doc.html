The ``real'' documentation is still the IPC7 paper.  Please send
me any suggestions you have about the framework, or things to add
to this document!

<p>
<em>This is new in version 0.6.</em>

<p>
(The module name has been changed to <tt>spark.py</tt>; new code should
<tt>import spark</tt> instead of <tt>import generic</tt>.)

      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc1">
1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>Token</tt> Class</H2>

<p>
The version of <tt>Token</tt> that's supplied is as minimal as possible.  The
only thing the framework assumes is a <tt>__cmp__</tt> method, so as long as
you adhere to this you can expand the class or drop in your own.

<p>
<tt>GenericParser</tt>'s default <tt>error</tt> method attempts to print out
the offending token in a readable form, so you may find it useful to have
a <tt>__str__</tt> or <tt>__repr__</tt> in your <tt>Token</tt> class too.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc2">
2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>AST</tt> Class</H2>

<p>
Like the <tt>Token</tt> class, the <tt>AST</tt> class is very minimal.  The
framework assumes that each <tt>AST</tt> node will have a string-valued
<tt>type</tt> attribute, and that the children of a node are obtainable
using the <tt>__getitem__</tt> method.  Again, you can roll your own
class with this type of interface too.

<p>
I prefer n-ary trees for my ASTs rather than binary trees, so the
example one in <tt>examples/paper</tt> is quite a bit different than my own.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>error</tt> Method</H3>

<p>
If the input is not matched by some point by regular expressions you've
supplied, then the <tt>error</tt> method will get called (in previous
versions an assertion was raised instead).  This method gets passed
the input string and the position within the string that the error
occurred.

<p>
<tt>GenericScanner</tt> provides a default implementation which prints out
an error message and raises a <tt>SystemExit</tt> exception.

<p>
I'm deliberating as to whether this should be a straight exception, or
if I should modify the interface to permit some form of error recovery...

      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Input Grammars</H3>

<p>
<tt>GenericParser</tt> should work with any Backus-Naur form (BNF) grammar,
including grammars
with empty right-hand sides and ambiguous grammars.
There are apparently a few rather obscure cases where Earley's parsing algorithm
fails, but they're not likely to crop up in any reasonable application.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>typestring</tt> Method</H3>

<p>
<em>This is new in version 0.6.</em>

<p>
<tt>GenericParser</tt> can often run faster if it knows the type of its
tokens.  More specifically, if it knows a token's type as a string.  You
can tell the parser this by supplying a <tt>typestring</tt> method, which is
passed a token, and must either return that token's type as a string, or
<tt>None</tt> if it's unable to (in the latter case, the parser will simply
fall back on a less-efficient method of operation).

<p>
For example, if a token's type is always stored in under the name <tt>type</tt>,
you might have the following code:

<p>

<pre>
class MyParser(GenericParser):
    ...
    def typestring(self, token):
        return token.type
</pre>

<p>
Note that <tt>GenericParser</tt> may or may not use <tt>typestring</tt>; your
tokens must still be comparable objects, as before.  Supplying <tt>typestring</tt>
is purely optional.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bugs/Limitations/Caveats</H3>

<p>

<DL compact><dt><b>Speed.</b></dt><dd> You're using a very general parsing algorithm
	implemented in Python; it's not going to be blazingly fast,
	sorry.

<p>
<dt><b>Action code.</b></dt><dd>  The entire input has been recognized by
	<tt>GenericParser</tt> before any of your action code is
	executed.  This may restrict the types of things you do on-the-fly
	in your parser actions.  It's one argument for building an AST
	that you can traverse any way you want.

<p>
<dt><b>Watch your method names.</b></dt><dd>  I've been bitten by this a few times.
	Python won't warn you if you inadventently redefine a method,
	which I've done when cutting and pasting a bit too freely.  It's
	a bugger to track down too.

<p>
</DL>      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc4.4">
4.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambiguity Resolution</H3>

<p>
Since the IPC7 paper, I had added some rudimentary ambiguity resolution code.
It was undocumented, far from satisfactory, and it has been supplanted by
the following interface.

<p>
Ambiguities are not resolved until the parse tree is being traversed.  In
other words, the input is already known to be syntactically correct; it's
just a matter of deciding which parse tree to build when there are multiple
choices.

<p>
When an ambiguity is reached, a choice will need to be made between two
or more rules.  These rules must reside in different <tt>p_</tt> methods.
The method names which correspond to the conflicting rules, minus the
initial ``<tt>p_</tt>,'' are gathered together in a list.  This list is
sorted by the length of the rules' right-hand side - shorter rules appear
earlier in the list - and passed to the <tt>resolve</tt> method.  The
<tt>resolve</tt> method must choose an element of the list and return its choice.

<p>
<tt>GenericParser</tt> supplies a default implementation of <tt>resolve</tt>
which always selects the rule with the shortest right-hand side (assuming
the conflicting rules reside in different <tt>p_</tt> methods, of course).
This is enough to handle the ``dangling-else'' conflict.

<p>
Now some examples.  The first one always picks the rule with the shortest
right-hand side (this is the default as supplied):

<p>

<pre>
class MyParser(GenericParser):
    ...
    def resolve(self, list):
        return list[0]
</pre>

<p>
The second example always picks the rule with the longest
right-hand side:

<p>

<pre>
class MyParser(GenericParser):
    ...
    def resolve(self, list):
        return list[-1]
</pre>

<p>
Here's one which exercises fine-grained control:

<p>

<pre>
class MyParser(GenericParser):
    ...
    def p_if_stmt(self, args):
        '''
            stmt ::= IF expr THEN stmt
        '''
    def p_ifelse_stmt(self, args):
        '''
            stmt ::= IF expr THEN stmt ELSE stmt
        '''
    ...
    def resolve(self, list):
        choice = {
            ('if_stmt', 'ifelse_stmt'): 'if_stmt',
        }
        return choice[tuple(list)]
</pre>

<p>
If you have an ambiguity, but aren't sure where, you may want to override
the default <tt>resolve</tt> with one that simply prints out the list it's
passed.  This allows you to find the guilty parties, and to ensure that there's
no duplicates in the list.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc5">
5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt> Class</H2>

<p>
This class will construct syntax trees for you automatically (or at
least with minimal intervention).  Instead of having your parser be a
subclass of <tt>GenericParser</tt>, you make it a subclass of
<tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt>.  <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt> is a subclass of
<tt>GenericParser</tt>, meaning the parsing interface is unchanged.

<p>
The constructor for <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt> takes an extra argument,
which is the <em>class</em> that you want AST nodes to be.

<p>
It's actually simpler than it sounds.  The rest of this section gives
a ``cookbook'' explanation.  The class of AST nodes is called ``AST''
in the examples below.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.1">
5.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Heterogeneous Parse Tree</H3>

<p>
Sometimes these are called ``concrete syntax trees.''  By heterogeneous
I mean that the leaves of the tree are instances of tokens rather than
instances of the AST class.  (See the <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> section
for more on this.)

<p>

<pre>
class AutoExprParser(GenericASTBuilder):
    def __init__(self, AST, start='expr'):
        GenericASTBuilder.__init__(self, AST, start)

    def p_expr(self, args):
        '''
            expr ::= expr + term
            expr ::= term
            term ::= term * factor
            term ::= factor
            factor ::= number
            factor ::= float
        '''
</pre>

<p>
That's it.  The code that uses it would look like:

<p>

<pre>
    parser = AutoExprParser(AST)
    parseTree = parser.parse(tokens)
</pre>

<p>
Except for the extra class argument to the constructor, there's no
changes.  In <tt>AutoExprParser</tt>, all the rules are lumped together
since there's no further need for actions.

<p>
The AST class must support the <tt>__setslice__</tt> and <tt>__len__</tt>
operations in order to use <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt>.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.2">
5.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Homogeneous Parse Tree</H3>

<p>
To make a homogeneous parse tree, the leaves need to be changed from
token instances into AST instances.  When <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt>
encounters a leaf, it calls <tt>GenericASTBuilder.terminal</tt>, so you
simply need to supply your own version of it:

<p>

<pre>
class AutoExprParser(GenericASTBuilder):
    ...
    def terminal(self, token):
        return AST(token.type)
</pre>

<p>
In practice, you'll probably want to copy some attribute values from the
token to the AST node too.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.3">
5.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any-geneous Abstract Syntax Tree</H3>

<p>
To use <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt> for building an abstract syntax tree,
there should be a fairly straightforward mapping between the parse tree
and the AST you want.  Just like <tt>GenericASTBuilder.terminal</tt> was
supplied in the last section, you'll now supply a
<tt>GenericASTBuilder.nonterminal</tt> method.  The arguments to this method
are the nonterminal it's trying to build a node for, and the node's children.

<p>
For example, if I wanted to flatten the parse tree out a bit, I could
skip allocating new nodes if there's only one child:

<p>

<pre>
class AutoExprParser(GenericASTBuilder):
    ...
    def nonterminal(self, type, args):
        if len(args) == 1:
            return args[0]
        return GenericASTBuilder.nonterminal(self, type, args)
</pre>

<p>
<tt>args</tt> is just a list, so you could also delete elements from it,
or any other transformation you can imagine.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc5.4">
5.4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bugs/Limitations/Caveats</H3>

<p>

<DL compact><dt><b>Ignorance.</b></dt><dd> Any parser actions you supply in your <tt>p_</tt> functions are
	silently ignored by <tt>GenericASTBuilder</tt> in the current version.
	This may change in the future.

<p>
</DL>      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc6">
6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> Class</H2>

<p>
This was called the <tt>ASTTraversal</tt> class in the IPC7 paper.  For
consistency, I've renamed it and placed it in <tt>spark.py</tt> along
with the other generic classes.  For backward compatibility,
<tt>ASTTraversal</tt> is still present in its old spot as a wrapper; new
code should use <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt>.

<p>
I got a great suggestion about heterogeneous ASTs: use the already-present
token instances as leaves of the AST.  I was all ready to add support
into <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> so that it only traversed a node's children
if the node had a <tt>__getitem__</tt> method present.  Then it
suddenly occurred to me that <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> already supports
heterogeneous ASTs: if you want to use tokens as leaves, just add a
method to your token class:

<pre>
class MyToken:
    ...
    def __getitem__(self, i):	raise IndexError
    ...
</pre>
This way the interface to <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> is kept simple.

<p>
If you want to prevent further traversal into a subtree during a
preorder traversal, calling the <tt>prune</tt> method will do the trick.  I
found I needed this when generating code from ASTs.

<p>
      <H3><A NAME="tth_sEc6.1">
6.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>typestring</tt> Method</H3>

<p>
<em>This is new in version 0.6.</em>

<p>
To decouple <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> from the node implementation,
<tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt> now calls the <tt>typestring</tt> method to
get the node's type as a string.  Like its counterpart in <tt>GenericParser</tt>,
it takes a node as an argument, and must return a string (it may not return
<tt>None</tt>, unlike the one in <tt>GenericParser</tt>).

<p>
The default implementation simply returns the node's <tt>type</tt> field; this
behaviour is backwards-compatible.

<p>
      <H2><A NAME="tth_sEc7">
7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <tt>GenericASTMatcher</tt> Class</H2>

<p>
<tt>GenericASTMatcher</tt> is a class that is designed for generating code
from ASTs.  You supply a set of patterns (in docstrings, of course) and
actions; <tt>GenericASTMatcher</tt> will find a way to cover the AST with
your patterns, then invoke the corresponding actions.  Actions are called
in left-to-right, bottom-up order.

<p>
For example:

<p>

<pre>
class AutoInterpret(GenericASTMatcher):
    def __init__(self, ast):
        GenericASTMatcher.__init__(self, 'V', ast)

    def p_n(self, tree):
        '''
            V ::= number
        '''
        tree.value = int(tree.attr)

    def p_add(self, tree):
        '''
            V ::= expr ( V + V )
        '''
        tree.value = tree[0].value + tree[2].value

    def p_multiply(self, tree):
        '''
            V ::= term ( V * V )
        '''
        tree.value = tree[0].value * tree[2].value

    def p_addmul(self, tree):
        '''
            V ::= expr ( V + term ( V * V ) )
        '''
        tree.value = tree[0].value + tree[2][0].value * tree[2][2].value
</pre>

<p>
As in <tt>GenericParser</tt>, the methods you supply are prefixed with
<tt>p_</tt>, which in this context stands for ``pattern.''  The argument
to the <tt>p_</tt> methods is the AST node where the pattern is rooted.

<p>
Patterns are just trees linearized into prefix
form, which use parentheses to denote
subtrees.  On the left-hand side is a symbol which the pattern is
effectively ``rewritten'' to if the pattern is matched.  For example,
the pattern <tt>V&nbsp;::=&nbsp;term&nbsp;(&nbsp;V&nbsp;*&nbsp;V&nbsp;)</tt> would correspond to:

<p>

<pre>
 term
  /|\    =&#62; V
 / | \
V  *  V
</pre>

<p>
You'd use the above class as follows:

<p>

<pre>
    interpreter = AutoInterpret(ast)
    interpreter.match()
    print ast.value
</pre>

<p>
You may optionally supply an AST to <tt>match</tt>.  This is so you can
create one instance of your matcher class, then have it match different
ASTs.  For instance, you could use a matcher for implementing a
language's arithmetic expressions, and use a <tt>GenericASTTraversal</tt>
for the rest.

<p>
AST nodes must support <tt>__getitem__</tt> and <tt>__cmp__</tt> methods
to use <tt>GenericASTMatcher</tt>.

<p>
<dt><b>How do I distribute a project that uses SPARK?</b></dt><dd>  As far as I'm
